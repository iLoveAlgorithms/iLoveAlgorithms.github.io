*(Full disclosure: I cannot say exactly that all this advice will apply for the current iteration of this course but I will keep them as general yet applicable as possible)*

**EXAM DATE**: 25/Nov/2024

## Introduction üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Hello, and first of all... Congratulations! By now, you should have your Something Awesome in the rear view mirror, and your weekly logbooks and activities being finalised. (Tutors frantically trying to mark everything on time)

But we are not finished just yet, with just 1 massive thing in hurdle in front of us. The **Final Exam**. While all of us would love to slip into a state of hibernation for the next 2 months, we have to do the exam regardless. 

Don't worry, there are a couple of things you can do prior and during the exam that can help with making this a ***minimally*** painful process.

## Pre-Exam Preparations ‚è≥

If you have made it this far in the course and have kept up will all the work, you are already as prepared as you can be! The great thing about the course is that its designed so you don't really have to revise.

But of course, some of you might not be comfortable with that thought and really, really, want to make sure you have covered everything.

While its good to cover each topic of the week, simply reading the slides (especially for this course) is not particularly helpful since it just a collection of bullet points.

### Advice:

(Feel free to do any additional revision practice into WebCMS blog posts, they won't be mark but it allows you to collect all your knowledge in one location.)

#### Review all the technical teaching:

One type of question that we can be guaranteed that will show up are the technical questions such as RSA. Below is list of technical topics which you should cover (I cannot confirm it is exhaustive so always double check, **Law students, you won't need to know this**)

- Maths behind RSA
- Types of Encryptions (Block Ciphers, Stream Cipher, etc)
- Properties of Hashes and Cryptographic Hashes
- How Asymmetric Encryption work
- Property of Hash/Encryption
- Bits of Work
- Bits of Security
- Zero Knowledge Proof
- How an enigma machine work (Practice the enigma machine question)
- Birthday Attack

Make sure you are as clear as you can be with the techniques. Teaching your peers about these content is always a great way to practice. But don't get to caught up with doing only these questions.


>[!COMP6841 - Wargames]
>
>For wargames related practice, if you are comfortable with doing all the wargames that have been released as well as explain how they work and why they work, you are suitably prepared.

#### Do any blog posts you haven't done

By now, there may be some blog posts you elect to ignore due to various constraints. This is the best time to do them! Since all the core activities are assessable, finishing them will give you the best practice of them all. (Those really long research activities are, and I am sorry to say, really good practice)

Since exam questions are similarly based on them, practising them will hone those analytical abilities needed to tackle them. If you are such a smart student that you have completed everything, you could always re-tackle some of them.

- Research another case for research based activities
- Was there any activity you wish personally really enjoyed and want to go further? Now's your chance.

Remember for analysis, points we like to see is:
- Have you justified your claims with educated guess? (Not all justification need hard citable information)
- What are the strength and flaws of your solutions and claims if you have made them?
- If you were to rank ideas, why would you rank them in the way that you did?

#### Attempt and discuss the sample exams

A sample exam is provide is a great resource in understanding the type of questions that will show up. A marking rubric will NOT be provided, so you can never be sure whether your are right. (Tutors may not be able to confirm complete correction)

So discuss with your peers, was there anything they mentioned that you really liked? Did they interpret the question differently. It is a balance between time and quality, but if you have to decide between including a point or leaving it out, write it in regardless.

#### Review the final exam skeleton

You will be given a skeleton to the final exam, which will give you very broad topic mention for each question. Some of the topic might allow you to guess the question, but never assume anything. It is enough to prime you to think and hone in certain topics where you can.

#### Watch the Exam movie:
This year's movie is *Dr Strangelove*. It's a great film, but besides that, you will be assessed on certain parts of this film and their approaches on security topics. A **legal** copy of it can be found in the recent announcements to be watched **legally**

Take notes about any time something occurs which relates to a security topic. Now this might not instantly be noticed, so simply make notes on the event, potential drama between characters, problems and how they being tackled.

## During exam ‚úç

We are all aware of the typical advice of the exams. Get good enough sleep, drink enough water, have a good meal, breathing, and the list goes on and on. However there are some specific tips here and there that can make things smoother.

### Advice

#### There might be some questions that are inherently time sinks. Save them for last

There are certain questions (like an enigma question from last year), which are simply something you have to muscle through before finding the answers. I recommend reading them, but saving them for later.

#### Double check the administrative information

Make sure your zID is all the appropriate place, and there is not too much spelling mistake in those places. Don't be too anxious with this but just be aware (If you wrote Barah instead of Sarah, we probably have a laugh at you in private and mark you normally)

#### Answer your question in a separate editor

The main submission is done via a text file. This is very prone to losing data just by nature of it requiring you to save it. Some people find it useful to do it in their own word editor (Word, Markdown, etc.) Something with autosaving is definitely a level of assurance you could. Save yourself 10 minutes to transfer these information into the exam if needed.

#### Taking time to think is expected

Some questions will require some thought and may not instantly be recognisable in their approach. This is entirely expected. Breathe, take a sip of water, and think about it. Jot down some notes, and if its still not obvious, feel free to skip it and come back to it later.

#### Sympathy Mark

Now, because we do not want you to put it a half ass answer and basically re-iterate the question back at us. We have presented y'all with the ability to use 1 sympathy mark for your exam. Which simply means if there is a question that you have no idea how to answer at all, simply write "Sympathy mark please", and we will give you 1 mark for that question.

However, if you have written answer, **the sympathy mark will invalidate your answer regardless of correctness**. Meaning if you got the question right but put down a sympathy mark request, we will only give you the one sympathy mark.

## Other Advice ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

If you have special consideration, please contact course as soon as possible. UNSW use a fit-to-sit policy which means if you sit for an exam, your are agreeing to the university that you are fit to complete the exam.

If at any point during the exam, something dire happens, such as power outages, internet outage, sudden illness, freak accidents, or spontaneous combustion. Please email the course (cs6441.cse.unsw.edu.au) as soon as you can with as much information about your circumstance and we can assist you from there on. The sooner, the better.

## Conclusion üë®‚Äçüéìüë©‚Äçüéì

If you have made it this far (and have been keeping up with work), you are as prepared as you can be. There will always be things that you can never predict so don't fret. Trust that the work you have done will carry you until the end.

Stay hydrates, sleep early, don't get sick and on behalf of all tutors, good luck and well done, you are at the finish line, just one more step!
